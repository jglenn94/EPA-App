<h1 align = "center">About Climate Change</h1>
<h2 align ="center">What is Climate Change?</h2>
<p align ="center">Climate Change is defined by the EPA as the long-term change in average weather conditions such as temperature, wind patterns, and precipitation. These occur over the span of many years, beyond lifetimes. Climate change is slowly influenced by the passage of time; in recent years a leading cause of climate change is human activity. Climate change is not the same as global warming, as global warming is a byproduct of climate change in and of itself.  This can be best seen through the burning of fossil fuels and the release of other greenhouse gasses. These can have devastating impacts on the environment and safety of organisms. </p>

<h2 align="center">How does it affect Ecosystems?</h2>
<p align ="center">In ecosystems, climate change raises the probability of risk posed by natural disasters. Wildfires become more prominent as plantlife become prone to burning from lack of rainfall. Flows of rivers and streams become inconsistent as snow melts at a slower rate than usual. Animals such as fish and birds are more likely to displace from their natural habitats as conditions change, putting them at higher risk. As a result of climate change, these environments become unstable as living conditions worsen and animals are no longer able to coexist to maintain the ecosystem.</p>

<h2 align="center">How does it affect Humans?</h2>
<p align ="center">This does not mean that human beings are exempt from the impacts of climate change. In day-to-day weather patterns, temperatures have become far more extreme. Year by year, hotter days are becoming comparatively hotter while colder days are comparatively colder across the United States. Precipitation has become less evenly distributed across the country, causing droughts in some areas while others become flooded, destroying property. Most of all, because of rising global temperatures, it is far more difficult currently to accurately predict trends in weather.</p>
